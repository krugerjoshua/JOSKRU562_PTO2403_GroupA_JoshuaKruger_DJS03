I've tried to improve the 'Book Connect' code to mak it more structured, easier to maintain and more readibale. Below are some key changes:

    1. Book Preview Elements:
        - I've simplified the repeated code for creating book preview elements by wrapping it in a single function called 'createBookPreview'.
    
    2. Dropdown Population:
        - Instead of repeating the code for populating genre and author dropdowns, we used a single function 'populateDropdown'.
    
    3. Applying Themes:
        - Created a function 'applyThemes' to switch between day and night mode depending on user selection.

    4. Event Listeners::
        - Added event listeners for different buttons and overlays, making the code more readable.

    5. Simple Toggle Function:
        -  Created a simple toggle function 'toggleOverlay' to show/hide overlays.

    6. Update List Button:
        -  Added the 'updateListButton' function to update the "Show more" button depending on how many books are left.

The redactoring made the code more modular, easier to read and maintain. The code is now more structured and follows best practices. With functions like 'createBookPreview', 'populateDropdown', 'applyThemes', 'toggleOverlay', the code is better organized and adheres to SOLID principles. Making it more robust and scalable. There is some known issues that I did not have enough time to finnish in time, like the pictures not showing and buttons not working when clicked on. I will make sure to address these issues in the next iteration.

The bug was found and corrected and upon teting everything seems to be working as expected.
